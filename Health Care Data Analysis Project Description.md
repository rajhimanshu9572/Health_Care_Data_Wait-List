Health Care Data - Patient Wait List 

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a Power BI dashboard that tracks and analyzes the patient waiting list data for both inpatient and outpatient categories over the period from 2018 to 2021. The dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive overview and detailed insights into the current status, historical trends, and specialty-level and age profile analysis of the patient waiting lists, utilizing key metrics such as average, median, and total wait lists.


Key Insights:
ðŸ“ŒCurrent Status Tracking: The dashboard will provide real-time tracking of the current total patient waiting list, enabling stakeholders to monitor and manage patient flow efficiently.

ðŸ“ŒHistorical Trends Analysis: By analyzing historical monthly trends of waiting lists for inpatient and outpatient categories, the dashboard will help identify patterns, peak times, and potential areas for improvement.

ðŸ“ŒSpecialty-Level Insights: Detailed analysis at the specialty level will allow for a deeper understanding of how different medical specialties are performing in terms of patient wait times, helping to identify bottlenecks and allocate resources more effectively.

ðŸ“ŒAge Profile Analysis: Incorporating age profile analysis will shed light on the distribution of waiting times across different age groups, offering insights into demographic-specific healthcare needs and challenges.

ðŸ“ŒKey Metrics Utilization: Using average and median waiting lists as metrics will provide a balanced view of the data, highlighting both typical and outlier values, while the total wait list metric will give a comprehensive picture of the overall burden on the healthcare system.

ðŸ“ŒUser-Friendly Design: The dashboard will be designed with a summary page for a high-level overview and a detailed page for granular analysis, ensuring it meets the needs of both strategic decision-makers and operational managers.
